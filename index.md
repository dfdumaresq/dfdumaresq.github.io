# David F. Dumaresq

I’m David F. Dumaresq (Dave), a senior software engineer transitioning 30+ years of experience—from 1980s expert systems to modern provincial infrastructure—into technical AI safety and alignment. I am currently on the API team at EducationPlannerBC and am a member of the faculty association at Simon Fraser University. My independent work focuses on AI steerability, agent fingerprinting, model evaluations, and governance tooling.

## Current work

At **EducationPlannerBC**, I help improve and maintain services that connect people to education and career opportunities through information, support, and technology.[page:0] The EPBC website is home to B.C.’s provincial post-secondary application service and resources that let students explore programs, admission requirements, and financial aid, and apply to any of the 25 public post-secondary institutions in the province.[page:0] On the API team, I work on backend services that support these application and information flows.

Separately from my work at EPBC, I pursue projects in AI safety, including AI agent fingerprinting, evaluation tooling, and related research collaborations.

## Writing and creative work

I’m also a published author and playwright. My work includes:

- **The Shame Game** – a published book exploring themes of shame and personal transformation.
- **Essays on AI and faith** – two published pieces examining how AI intersects with religious imagination and moral responsibility.
- **Stage plays on AI safety** – three plays exploring the ethical tipping points of exponential AI, the societal impacts of automation, and the blurring lines between human and machine intelligence.
  - Most recently: *The Golden Goose is Near*, available from major booksellers. [Read more ›](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-golden-goose-is-near-david-f-dumaresq/1146212559)[cite:11][web:121]

These projects sit alongside my technical work and reflect a long‑running interest in how people make sense of powerful technologies, not just how we build them.

## Selected projects

### AI Fingerprint

A project exploring ways to identify and verify AI-generated behavior and artifacts to support governance and accountability in multi‑agent AI ecosystems.[cite:1][web:117][web:119]

- Focus: AI agent fingerprinting to mitigate Sybil attacks and detect model substitution in deployed agents.[cite:1][web:117][web:119]
- Role: Architected and built an immutable registry (Ethereum/Solidity) for AI agent identity and provenance.[cite:1][web:117]
- Links: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfdumaresq/Fingerprint)[web:117]


### Virtues AI

An experiment in framing AI system behavior and evaluation around virtue-ethics-inspired principles.

- Focus: AI behavior evaluation and active refusal of unethical premises.
- Role: Fine-tuned Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to promote virtues like honesty over neutral engagement. Overcame stability challenges for training on Apple Silicon.
- Links: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfdumaresq/virtue-ai)

### Kaggle: Deep Past

Applied machine learning to historical or archaeological-style data (Kaggle project "deep past").

- Focus: Practical ML pipeline, feature engineering, evaluation.
- Role: End-to-end modeling and analysis.

### Operation Alpine Recovery

**Operation Alpine Recovery** was a proposal developed for an idea competition launched by armasuisse to address the long-standing issue of submerged military munitions in Swiss Alpine lakes. Between 1918 and 1964, more than 12,000 tonnes of unused ammunition were disposed of in lakes including Thun, Lucerne, and Brienz, where they remain at depths of up to 220 metres.

The project outlined a phased, environmentally responsible concept combining high-resolution mapping, underwater robotics, and controlled encapsulation methods designed to minimize sediment disturbance and ecological impact. Rather than proposing immediate deployment, the submission positioned itself as a technical and research-oriented framework to inform future feasibility studies or pilot initiatives.

Developed by a small interdisciplinary team, the completed proposal attracted preliminary interest from Canadian industry representatives willing to supply relevant survey and robotics equipment and was submitted ahead of the February 2025 competition deadline.

### Stage play: *The Golden Goose is Near*

Stage play work supported by AI for dramaturgy and iteration.

- Focus: Story structure, dialogue exploration, and thematic development.
- Role: Playwright; used AI as a creative assistant.

## Work, teaching, and research

- Faculty at Simon Fraser University (SFU), teaching and mentoring in software engineering and AI-related topics.
- Completed and taught AI safety coursework, including RLHF, interpretability, robust agents, and evaluations.
- Ongoing work on backend resilience, caching, and verification patterns.
