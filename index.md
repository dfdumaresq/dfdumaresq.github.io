# David F. Dumaresq

I’m David F. Dumaresq (Dave), a senior software engineer transitioning 30+ years of experience—from 1980s expert systems to modern provincial infrastructure—into technical AI safety and alignment. I  currently work on the API team at EducationPlannerBC and am a member of the faculty association at Simon Fraser University. My independent work focuses on AI steerability, agent fingerprinting, model evaluations, and governance tooling.

## Current work

At **EducationPlannerBC**, I help improve and maintain services that connect people to education and career opportunities through information, support, and technology.[page:0] The EPBC website is home to B.C.’s provincial post-secondary application service and resources that let students explore programs, admission requirements, and financial aid, and apply to any of the 25 public post-secondary institutions in the province.[page:0] On the API team, I work on backend services that support these application and information flows.

Separately from my work at EPBC, I pursue projects in AI safety, including AI agent fingerprinting, evaluation tooling, and related research collaborations.

## Writing and creative work

I’m also a published author and playwright. My work includes:

- **The Shame Game** – a published book exploring themes of shame and personal transformation.
- **Essays on AI and faith** – two published pieces examining how AI intersects with religious imagination and moral responsibility.
- **Stage plays on AI safety** – three plays exploring the ethical tipping points of exponential AI, the societal impacts of automation, and the blurring lines between human and machine intelligence.
  - Most recently: *The Golden Goose is Near*, available from major booksellers. [Read more ›](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-golden-goose-is-near-david-f-dumaresq/1146212559)
  - Selected stage plays are available on request; I’m happy to share scripts or production information.

These projects sit alongside my technical work and reflect a long‑running interest in how people make sense of powerful technologies, not just how we build them.


## Selected projects

### AI Fingerprint

A project exploring ways to identify and verify AI-generated behavior and artifacts to support governance and accountability in multi‑agent AI ecosystems.[cite:1][web:117][web:119]

- Focus: AI agent fingerprinting to mitigate Sybil attacks and detect model substitution in deployed agents.[cite:1][web:117][web:119]
- Role: Architected and built an immutable registry (Ethereum/Solidity) for AI agent identity and provenance.[cite:1][web:117]
- Links: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfdumaresq/Fingerprint)[web:117]


### Virtues AI

An experiment in framing AI system behavior and evaluation around virtue-ethics-inspired principles.

- Focus: AI behavior evaluation and active refusal of unethical premises.
- Role: Fine-tuned Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to promote virtues like honesty over neutral engagement. Overcame stability challenges for training on Apple Silicon.
- Links: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfdumaresq/virtue-ai)

### Kaggle: Deep Past

Applied machine learning to historical or archaeological-style data (Kaggle project "deep past").

- Why it matters: Demonstrated an end‑to‑end ML workflow on noisy, real‑world data, from feature engineering to evaluation, under leaderboard pressure.
- Focus: Practical ML pipeline, feature engineering, evaluation.
- Role: End-to-end modeling and analysis.
- Links: <!-- TODO: add Kaggle link -->

### Operation Alpine Recovery

A proposal for an armasuisse idea competition to address submerged military munitions in Swiss Alpine lakes. It outlined a phased, environmentally responsible concept using high‑resolution mapping, underwater robotics, and controlled encapsulation to minimize ecological impact. The framework was intended to inform future feasibility studies and pilot projects and drew preliminary interest from Canadian survey and robotics partners.

- Why it matters: Shows how technical framing and scenario design can help address slow‑burn environmental hazards and high‑stakes remediation.
- Role: Team Lead
- Links: <!-- TODO: add PDF or writeup -->

### Stage play: *The Golden Goose is Near*

Stage play work supported by AI for dramaturgy and iteration.

- Why it matters: Uses theatre to explore how people respond to powerful AI systems, complementing technical safety work with narrative stress‑testing of futures.
- Focus: Story structure, dialogue exploration, and thematic development.
- Role: Playwright; used AI as a creative assistant.

## Work and research

- Previously worked as a Software Engineer on the AI-driven "Project DOCENT" at Simon Fraser University (1989-1991), implementing graphical knowledge representation in Prolog.
- Completed BlueDot Impact's "Technical AI Safety" and "Intro to Transformative AI" courses.
- Ongoing work on backend resilience, caching, and verification patterns.
